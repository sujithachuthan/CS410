(Learning to Rank)  General idea:  Given a query-doc pair (Q ,D), define various kinds of features Xi(Q ,D) Examples of feature: the number of overlapping terms, BM25 score of Q and D, p(Q|D), PageRank of D, p(Q|Di), where Di may be anchor text or big font text, does the URL contain ~?. Hypothesize p(R=1|Q ,D)=s(X1(Q ,D),,Xn(Q ,D), ) where  is a set of parameters Learn  by fitting function s with training data, i.e., 3-tuples like (D, Q , 1) (D is relevant to Q) or (D,Q ,0) (D is non-relevant to Q)  3  Regression-Based Approaches  Logistic Regression: Xi(Q,D) is feature; s are parameters  Estimate s  by maximizing the likelihood of training data  X1(Q,D)      X2 (Q,D)     X3(Q,D) BM25         PageRank    BM25Anchor D1 (R=1)     0.7                  0.11             0.65 D2 (R=0)      0.3                 0.05              0.4  Once s are known, we can take Xi(Q,D) computed based on a new query and a new document  to generate a score for D w.r.t.

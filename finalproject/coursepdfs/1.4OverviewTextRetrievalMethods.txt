Term Frequency (TF):    c(presidential, d)  How long is d?        Document length:    |d|  How often do we see presidential in the entire collection? Document Frequency:  df(presidential) P(presidential|collection)  5   Which Model Works the Best?  When optimized, the following models tend to perform equally well [Fang  et al. 11]: Pivoted length normalization BM25 Query likelihood PL2 BM25 is most popular  6  Summary  Design of ranking function f(q,d) pre-requires a computational definition of relevance (retrieval model) Many models are equally effective with no single winner State of the art ranking functions tend to rely on  Bag of words representation Term Frequency (TF) and Document Frequency (DF) of words Document length  7   Additional Readings  Detailed discussion and comparison of state of the art models  Hui Fang, Tao Tao, and Chengxiang Zhai. 2011.

That s the best part of this hotel!The rooms are getting really old. Bathroom was nasty. The fixtures were falling off, lots of cracks and everything looked dirty. I dont think it worth the price.Service was the most disappointing part, especially the door men. this is not how you treat guests, this is not hospitality.  0.86  0.04  0.10  2  Sample Result 1: Rating Decomposition [Wang et al. 10]  Hotels with the same overall rating but different aspect ratings  (All 5 Stars hotels, ground-truth in parenthesis)  Hotel  HOTEL 1  HOTEL 2  HOTEL 3  Value  Room  Location  Cleanliness  4.2(4.7)  3.8(3.1)  4.0(4.2)  4.1(4.2)  4.3(4.0)  3.9(3.3)  3.7(3.1)  4.2(4.7)  3.7(3.8)  4.4(3.8)  4.1(4.9)  4.5(4.8)  Reveal detailed opinions at the aspect level  3          Sample Result 2: Comparison of Reviewers [Wang et al. 10]  Per-Reviewer Analysis  Different reviewers ratings on the same hotel  Reviewer  Value  Room  Location  Cleanliness  Reviewer 1  3.7(4.0)  3.5(4.0)  3.7(4.0)  5.8(5.0)  Reviewer 2  5.0(5.0)  3.0(3.0)  5.0(4.0)  3.5(4.0)  Reveal differences in opinions of different reviewers  4       Sample Result 3: Aspect-Specific Sentiment Lexicon [Wang et al. 10]  Value  Rooms  Location  resort  22.80 value  19.64  view  28.05 comfortable  23.15  restaurant  24.47 walk  18.89  excellent  19.54  modern  15.82  bus  14.32  Cleanliness  clean  55.35 smell  14.38  linen  14.25  worth  19.20  bad  -24.09  money  -11.02  terrible  -10.01  quiet  15.37  carpet  -9.88  smell  -8.83  dirty  -7.85  beach  14.11  maintain  13.51  wall  -11.70  smelly  -0.53  overprice  -9.06  stain   -5.85  website  -1.67  bad  -5.40  road  -2.90  urine  -0.43  filthy  -0.42  dingy  -0.38  Learn sentimental information directly from the data.  5  Sample Result 4: Validating Preference Weights [Wang et al. 10]  Top-10: Reviewers with the highest Val/X ratio (emphasize value)  Bot-10: Reviewers with the lowest Val/X ratio (emphasize a non-value aspect)  City  Avg.

Overall not a negative experience; however, considering that the hotel industry is very much in the impressing business, there was a lot of room for improvement.  The location, a short walk to downtown and Pike Place market, made the hotel a good choice.  When you visit a big metropolitan city, be prepared to hear a little traffic outside!  You can pay for wireless by the day or use the complimentary Internet in the business center behind the lobby, though.  My only complaint is the daily charge for Internet access when you can pretty much connect to wireless on the streets anymore.  3.1  1.7  3.7  1.2  2.7  0.9  7  Application 2: Discover Consumer Preferences [Wang et al. 2011]  Amazon reviews: No guidance  battery life accessory service  file format volume video  8   Application 3: User Rating Behavior Analysis [Wang et al. 10]  Expensive Hotel  Cheap Hotel  5 Stars  3 Stars  5 Stars  Value  Room  Location  Cleanliness  0.134  0.098  0.171  0.081  0.148  0.162  0.074  0.163  Service  0.251  0.101  0.171  0.126  0.161  0.116  0.101  1 Star  0.093  0.121  0.082  0.294  0.049  People  like  expensive hotels because of  good service.

Sentiment analysis can be done using text categorization techniques  With enriched feature representation With consideration of ordering of the categories  Generative models are powerful for mining latent user preferences Most approaches were proposed for product reviews Opinion mining from news and social media remains challenging  11  Suggested Reading  Bing Liu, Sentiment analysis and opinion mining, Morgan & Claypool Publishers, 2012.

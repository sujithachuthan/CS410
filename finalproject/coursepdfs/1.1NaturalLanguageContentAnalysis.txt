State of the Art in NLP NLP for Text Retrieval  3                An Example of NLP  A   dog   is   chasing   a   boy   on   the   playground  Det Noun Aux  Verb  Det Noun Prep Det  Noun  Noun Phrase Complex Verb  Noun Phrase  Lexical analysis (part-of-speech tagging)  Noun Phrase  Prep Phrase  Semantic analysis  Dog(d1). Boy(b1). Playground(p1). Chasing(d1,b1,p1).  +  Scared(x) if Chasing(_,x,_).  Scared(b1)  Inference  Verb Phrase  Verb Phrase  Sentence  Syntactic analysis (Parsing)  A person saying this may be reminding another person to get the dog back  Pragmatic analysis (speech act)  4  NLP Is Difficult!  Natural language is designed to make human communication efficient. As a result, we omit a lot of common sense knowledge, which we assume the hearer/reader possesses we keep a lot of ambiguities, which we assume the hearer/reader knows how to resolve This makes EVERY step in NLP hard Ambiguity is a killer ! Common sense reasoning is pre-required  5   Examples of Challenges  Word-level ambiguity: E.g.,  design can be a noun or a verb (Ambiguous POS) root has multiple meanings (Ambiguous sense)  Syntactic ambiguity: E.g.,  natural language processing (Modification) A man saw a boy with a telescope. (PP Attachment)  Anaphora resolution: John persuaded Bill to buy a TV for himself. (himself = John or Bill?) Presupposition: He has quit smoking. implies that he smoked before.  6  The State of the Art  A   dog   is   chasing   a   boy   on   the   playground  Det Noun Aux  Verb  Det Noun Prep Det  Noun  POS Tagging: 97%  Noun Phrase Complex Verb  Noun Phrase  Noun Phrase  Prep Phrase  Verb Phrase  Parsing: partial >90%(?)  Semantics: some aspects  - Entity/relation extraction - Word sense disambiguation - Sentiment analysis  Inference: ???  Verb Phrase  Sentence  Speech act analysis: ???  7   What We Cant Do  100% POS tagging  He turned off the highway. vs He turned off the fan.  General complete parsing  A man saw a boy with a telescope.  Precise deep semantic analysis  Will we ever be able to precisely define the meaning of own  in John owns a restaurant.?  Robust  & general NLP tends to be shallow while deep understanding doesnt scale up  8    NLP for Text Retrieval  Must be general robust & efficient  Shallow NLP Bag of words representation tends to be sufficient for most search tasks (but not all!) Some text retrieval techniques can naturally address NLP problems However, deeper NLP is needed for complex search tasks  9  Summary  What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
